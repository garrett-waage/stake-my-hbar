# *stake-my-hbar*
A web application that allows users to 
* enable native staking on the Hedera network for their account
* counts down until account 0.0.800 holds 250 million hbar and staking rewards are enabled to pay out

# The need for *stake-my-hbar*
* Staking on the Hedera network is going live on the mainnet TOMORROW, July 7/21, yet there doesn't seem to be a community application yet that is on track to actually offer this feature of enabling staking. 
* Staking won't actually pay out until Account 0.0.800 has 250 million Hbar yet there isn't a lot of visibility into that account's balance. 

There's a long road ahead - why not join in and watch it on stake-my-hbar?

# Why native stake? 
* Power the network that you're invested in and leverage
* Exercise your democratic power to stake who you want
* Generate passive income on your hbar in the **safest** way

# What about open source?
In the future I can see open sourcing *stake-my-hbar* with the goal of showcasing an application built on Hedera to lower the barrier of entry into this space.
